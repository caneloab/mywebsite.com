<div class="container">
    <h2 class="mode-status">Currently in Light Mode</h2>

      <input type="checkbox" id="mode-toggle">
      <span class="slider"></span>
    </label>
    <p>In this page, I made a dark mode toggler like we did in the mini project where we made a dark mode toggler</p>
    <p>I wanted to add this to the image carousel page, but there were some conflicts that were making it difficult to work</p>
    <p>Hopefully, this turns out well and I can figure out a way to condense this page into the other one.</p>
